# ContenTube<sub><sup> - The ultimate search engine for videos. No more clickbait!</sup></sub>
By [Dan](github.com/defroni) and [Jonathan](github.com/CSN3RD)

## Information Retrieval (IR) Systems
- We implementetd the search feature using TF-IDF, a heuristic to determine and rank the best matches for a given input query.
- To determine how good our search engine is, we developed 3 independent IR systems to compare. They are based on:

  1. Title
  2. Description
  3. Content

## Dataset
1. Ted Talks
2. Clickbait Videos and Podcasts

## Final Demo
[Insert screenshots (or links?) here]

## Evaluation
- We evaluated the success of our content based IR system in comparison to the other 2 IR systems. Metrics we used:
  - Order Unaware: Precision (P), Recall (R), Accuracy (A), F Measuree (F1 score)
  - Order Aware: Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Average Precision (AP), Mean Average Precision (MAP), Cumulative Gain (CG), Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)

## Results
[Insert results of different evaluation metrics]
